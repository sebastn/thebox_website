### Why this web page?
Continued movement is the decisive factor to stay fit and healthy at any age. With our parents as part of the ageing generation (65+), we noted their difficulty accessing and finding the right workouts for them. We put together this webpage, where they can find a new and suited video for their home workout every day. Just bookmark our workout page for easy access.


### Who are we?
We are three friends who met working in Berlin and are fascinated by sports and movement. Marcel is a sport scientist and personal trainer, who used to be a professional athlete. Sebastian is a software & hardware engineer, who loves hiking and used to build movement tracking software. Leonhard is a medical doctor and triathlon coach who used to work in sports and nutritional consulting.

### How do the videos get selected?
We are selecting the videos ourself with our parent’s needs in mind. We try to find videos which are low impact (no jumping), don’t require maximum strength (not 50 pushups in a row) and are possible to follow at every fitness level (enough breaks between the exercises). Of course workouts are not a one size fits all solution, so please leave a comment about what you liked or disliked about the chosen video. If you know a suitable video which you would like to share, please send us the link via the contact form.
